AI Chatbot with TF-IDF Vectorization and Cosine Similarity

This repository implements an AI chatbot that utilizes TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity to understand and respond to user queries. This approach allows the chatbot to analyze keywords and their importance within a corpus of text data, enabling it to find the most relevant responses to your questions.

Key Features:

TF-IDF Vectorization: Identifies and weights keywords based on their frequency within the corpus and rarity across the entire dataset.
Cosine Similarity: Measures the semantic similarity between the user's query and the stored responses, ensuring accurate and relevant answers.
Customizable: Easily adaptable to various domains and datasets by modifying the corpus of text data.
Open-Source: Freely available for exploration, modification, and contribution.
Benefits:

Improved Accuracy: Provides more precise and insightful responses compared to rule-based chatbots.
Flexibility: Adapts to diverse conversation topics and contexts.
Scalability: Easily scales to handle larger datasets and more complex interactions.
